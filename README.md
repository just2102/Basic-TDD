# Basic-TDD
## In this little project I learned the basics of TDD and wrote a few simple tests to check if they output correct results.
## Tests are implemented with Jest framework and include:
### Capitalize string (capitalize.test.js)
### Reverse string (reverse.test.js)
### Calculator (calculator.test.js)
##### Including add, subtract, divide and multiply operations
